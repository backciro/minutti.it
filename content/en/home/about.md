I'm a Professional Solution Designer, intended to solve all the problems I deal with.

Everyday I improve my skills with all these **technologies**:

* _**Google Cloud Platform**_ for manage all my infrastructures;
    <!-- - App Engine & Compute Engine -->
    <!-- - Cloud Function Clusters -->
* _**Firebase**_ as identity provider for secure client services;
    <!-- - Firebase Realtime Database -->
* _**AWS**_ in order to save persistent-redundant copies of my data:
    - PostgreSQL
    - Amazon Aurora&reg;

* _**node.js**_ for building state-of-art REST or event-driven API, with a few tricks:
    - Only _**TypeScript**_ Inside. Compile-time typecheck is better than you think! 
    - _**Typeorm**_ as query builder allow a perfect data sanitization and fraud deterrent...

* **Angular 7+** for create fancy responsive interfaces and powerful PWAs;
* **Flutter Framework** for design native mobiles app for iOS and Android;
