When I was 19, me and some friend started a collective business aiming to blow up in the hiphop music scene.

No, I'm not a rapper or something like that, I've just only had a good idea to manage all our single talents in a single funnel.

This funnel is [Sao Square Corp.](https://saosquarecorp.com), our collective name.

We're just skilled guys with different scopes, and we're tryna to make something big all together;
I've done some job of administration and started my first business as freelance developer, managing alone the website construction
