After a somewhat eventful period, I've met Mr. Fiorilli that believing in my capabilities at the age of 23 proposes me to co-found a company, in which I would have had the total responsibility for software developments.

Thus began, on July 18 2019, my adventure as CEO (and also CTO) in **[SILPH Technologies](https://silph.tech)**. In these two years we developed few product and service and many PoC, hired a developer and conquer some important customers onto international panorama, e.g.: 
- _[Smeralda Holding](https://www.smeraldaholding.com)_  
- _[Klepierre Management Italia](https://www.klepierre.com)_
